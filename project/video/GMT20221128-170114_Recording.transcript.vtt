00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Jenna Jiang: Oh, 3, 2 one start. Okay.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:19.219
Jenna Jiang: This project aims to predict the winner of fifa, 2,022 world cup games, using the data set international matches available on Kaggle. It's linked right here, and the idea is inspired by the current. If you find in Qatar as well as the Chicago pose referenced over here.

3
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.539
Jenna Jiang: These are the modules imported that will be basically using used for graphing and also Csv reading and writing.

4
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:41.010
Jenna Jiang: The user will be presented with 4 functions. The first one is getting a historical results of a particular country. For example, if we choose Hr.

5
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.649
Jenna Jiang: the user will be prompted to typing in a country that of their interest. But, however, if we input a

6
00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:02.639
Jenna Jiang: country that is not part of the given file, it will be giving an output of country not found. Please enter a valid country name. This is made available by this function. Check country, chosen country that we created.

7
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.839
Jenna Jiang: So let's try a valid country which is Argentina.

8
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:22.449
Jenna Jiang: This will be the graph shown to to to show the wins losses and draws of Argentina since 1,993, basically counting all number of matches played by Argentina in the given file.

9
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:38.180
Jenna Jiang: An extended way of this function is to compare the results. For example, we choose Mexico as a second function. It will give a comparison of historical results in a var of chart, so that the user can better visualize their results. 150,

10
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.619
Yi Zou: so the second function will be Tt: the total winners of the workout teams and the top.

11
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.080
Yi Zou: 22 scoring among them.

12
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.500
Yi Zou: The user will be given 2 choices

13
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.779
Yi Zou: which will be presenting the top 20 winning teams ever participating in the World Cup tournament

14
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.750
Yi Zou: or the top 20 scoring teams. In the 5

15
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.950
Yi Zou: the winning condition will be, including both the friendly matches and the fever award tournaments.

16
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.709
Jenna Jiang: This is the P. Function.

17
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.480
Yi Zou: and this is

18
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.050
Jenna Jiang: the T function.

19
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.629
Jenna Jiang: The third menu option that the user will be given is to predict the results between 2 given countries.

20
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.399
Jenna Jiang: The user will be prompted to enter a country

21
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.050
Jenna Jiang: of their interest. For example, Last week Japan played against

22
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.490
Jenna Jiang: Germany.

23
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.580
Jenna Jiang: and the second country will be Germany.

24
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:55.039
Jenna Jiang: and if they wanted to predict the results between these 2 countries, we will loop through the entire given file to find each country's total scores, and the number of 150,

25
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:05.239
Jenna Jiang: and the number of matches played to get their average scores, and from average scores we get their probability with a concluding sentence of which country has a higher probability to win.

26
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.829
Yi Zou: So the last function will be asking whether the user wants to add new match to resort to the file.

27
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.390
Yi Zou: The user will be showing a series of questions, asking them on what date was the match

28
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.489
Yi Zou: on the home team for the away teams and where the area the both teams of

29
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.990
Yi Zou: and what the scores they scored.

30
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.859
Yi Zou: all the results

31
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.770
Yi Zou: recorded to the Csb files we opened from the beginning.

32
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.479
Jenna Jiang: Yes, these are an example that we input it, and that will

33
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.020
Jenna Jiang: become part of the given Cs file.

34
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.990
Jenna Jiang: And if you want to end the program, I type in a

35
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.090
Jenna Jiang: okay perfect.
